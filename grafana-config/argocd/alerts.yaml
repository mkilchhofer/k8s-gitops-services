      description: >
        Argo CD has not reported any applications data for the past 15 minutes which
        means that it must be down or not functioning properly.  This needs to be
        resolved for this cloud to continue to maintain state.

      description: >
        The application '{{$labels.name}}' has not been synchronized for over
        12 hours which means that the state of this cloud has drifted away from the
        state inside Git.

      summary: "Argo CD Application many sync"
      description: >
        The application '{{$labels.name}}' has been synchronized more than 5 times within
        30 minutes. This mostly happens when Argo CD continuously detects a drift from your
        desired state. Possible reasons:\n
        - A Deployment specifies spec.replicas while HPA is also active\n
        - An operator/controller makes changes which are not defined in Git\n
        - An Admissions Enforcer is mutating your admission controller webhooks\n
          (E.g. on Azure AKS)
